		<p>Chad, <em>pictured on the left</em>,	 grew up in Kansas, where he spent a lot of time on the farm and in 4H.
		Before Chad established <strong>Plumb Line Services LLC.</strong>, 
		he was a horse trainer. After the business started to slow down, he decided to
		get into construction, something he always had a natural ability at. Chad has
		a lovely wife, Brenda Brown, and two amazing children, Hannah and Brady Brown.</p>
		
		<p>Plumb Line Services LLC. was established by Chad Brown in 2005. He had 
		just entered the world of self-employment and was determined to work to build 
		the business from the ground up. Now, over a decade later, he has created 
		a business that he is proud to call his own. The main focus of his business 
		is window and door installation, but also works in many other construction areas.</p>
